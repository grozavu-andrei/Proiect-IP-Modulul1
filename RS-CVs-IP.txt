				Risk Study on CV websites

The database for the websites that offer free CVs is small and the search engine does not offer many options unlike for the websites that require money for access.

Websites that require a certain amount of money to access their CV database:

•	Bestjobs.eu 
5 euro per applicant or 10 euro per CV you wish to unlock

•	Myjob.ro 
2 euro per CV you wish to unlock

•	Totaljobs.com 
250 pounds for 1week access to the CV database

•	Careerstructure.com 
190 pounds for 1day access

•	Netjobs.ro 
20 euro for 20CVs, 39 euro for 50 CVs,etc.

•	Ecruiters.ukstaffsearch.com 
offers a free search but if you want access to a CV you must pay a fee that depends on the expected salary put by the CV owner (example: 1.38 pounds for ES 15k-20k pounds, 0.92 pounds for ES 10k-15k pounds)


Websites that are free of charge:
•	Ejobs.ro 
CV can be public or private, if an employer wants to see the personal content of the CV, they must send an email to the admin of the website asking for permission which will be sent to the CV owner that will either refuse or accept

•	Jobseeker.eresumex.com 
offers free access to their DB but the search engine is not that good

•	Jobs.bizoo.ro
