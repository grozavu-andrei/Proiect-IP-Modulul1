		There are 3 main main types when making a good CV:

1) Chronological CV

A chronological CV focuses more on the job history of the individual and less on each individual
quality. Because of this, a chronological CV is a better fit for people with more work experience.

-> Structure: 

- Personal Details (i.e. name and contact details)
- Personal Profile
- Career History in reverse chronological order 
  (unless you are a graduate or you have very little work experience, 
   in which case, it may be best to start with your Education and Qualifications)
- Education and Qualifications
- Professional Memberships
- Other Information
- Interests


2) Functional CV

A functional CV is the opposite of a chronological CV in the fact that it sets the job history aside
and puts the spotlight on the personal profile of the individual. It is a good fit for those
who have gaps in their employment or have done a lot of volunteer work.

-> Structure:

- Personal profile
- A succession of sections, each relating to a different skill or ability
- Career Summary
- Education and Trainig
- Further courses
- Additional information
- Interests

3) Combined CV

A combined CV is a combination of the above listed types. It spotlights a person's qualities, but
it backs up the information with relevant examples from concrete jobs preferable in a chronological
order.

-> Structure:

- Professional Profile
- Skills and Experience
- Career History
- Education and Trainig
- Professional Training
- Interests
